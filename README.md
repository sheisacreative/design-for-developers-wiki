# 📩 Send your design questions

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/sheisacreative/design-for-developers-wiki/issues) in this repository.
2. Use the label "question" to indicate that it is a question.
3. Make sure your question is clear. You can even share an image to demonstrate it.

`🙊 Note: please, don't show me your screen and ask if your design is good. For this repo to work, I am looking for generic cases as they can benefit more people. `

<br>

# ❓ How this wiki works

- You ask a question, I answer.
- If the question seems like an opportunity for other people to learn from it I will add the answer to the wiki.
- I'll also add general knowledge I've learned over the more than 10 years as a designer.
- With time we will have a trustworthy source to learn and evolve the conversation beyond design and code.

<br>

# 🤔 Why this wiki?

- I want to help to break the barriers between design and code.
- I have a lot to share.
- We can learn and grow together.

<br>

# 🎈 Additional context

- As an UI/UX Designer, I am interested in how developers think while they design.
- I will also be adding content to the wiki based on my own knowledge and experience.
- If you have suggestions for topics you'd like me to cover, feel free to submit an issue with the label "enhancement".

<br>

# 🤔 Who is Maiane?

- A Designer with over 10 years experience.
- Freelance UI/UX Designer (yep, your company can [hire my services](https://sheisacreative.com/))
- Someone who just likes to study code as a hobby.

<br>

# ➕ More info

- There are huge chances you will find a few English errors in this project. As this is not my primary language, I will be really glad if you open an issue with the "enhancement" label reporting the error.
- If your company is looking for high quality design with outstanding level of excelence, I am a Freelance UI/UX Designer, feel free to [drop me a message](https://sheisacreative.com/contact).
