Have you ever had questions about design or just wanted to learn design from a designer who has some coding knowledge?

🌟 It's your time to shine! 🌟

The Design for Developers Wiki is a personal effort and you can help me to build it by [asking your design questions](#what-kind-of-questions-i-can-ask).

[**Enter the Design for Developers Wiki →**](pages/index.mdx)

## How the wiki works?

Developers will ask the questions and I will answer.

If the question seems like an opportunity for other people to learn from it I will add the answer to the wiki, so more developers can benefit from it.

## What kind of questions I can ask?

If you think your question may benefit you and others, then it is a good fit.

There's just one thing I ask:

**Don't show me your screen and ask if you design is good.** For this repo to work, I am looking for generic cases as they can benefit more people.

You can share an image to demonstrate your question, but if you are looking for Design Review, this is not the place.

## How can I send a question?

That's simple!

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/sheisacreative/design-for-developers-wiki/issues) in this repository.
2. Use the label "question" to indicate that it is a question.
3. Make sure your question is clear. You can even share an image to demonstrate it.

## Additional knowledge

- As an UI/UX Designer, I am interested in how developers think while they design.
- I will also be adding content to the wiki based on my own knowledge and experience.
- If you have suggestions for topics you'd like me to cover, feel free to submit an issue with the label "enhancement".

## Other comments

- 🌟 I am a single person, so it may take a few days to answer your question.
- 🌟 By the end of the day, I am just an adverturer designer in the Github world, please be patient as I am still learning about collaboration, open source and all this craziness. :P
- 🌟 There's a huge chance you will find a few English errors in this project, as this is not my primary language. I will be really glad if you open an issue with the "enhancement" label reporting the error.
- 🌟 If your company is looking for high quality design with outstangin level of excelence, I am a Freelance UI/UX Designer, feel free to [drop me a message](https://sheisacreative.com/contact).

# 💻 Technologies

This project was made using the follow technologies:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- Javascript
- NotionHQ

# 🚀 Features

There are a lot of quotation websites.
But how to guarantee who wrote the sentences?
How to make sure we are giving proper credits?

This is what Quack Quotes aims to fix. Curated quotes.
Quack Quotes values quality over quantity.

This project is part of a volunteer project I manage for Brazilian students, [Quack Redação](https://quackredacao.com.br/about-us/). It was born in 2016 and we help students to get bet on writing essays.
