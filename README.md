# Design for Developers Wiki

Hey, Developer!

Have you ever had questions about design or just wanted to learn design from a designer who has some coding knowledge?

ðŸŒŸ It's your time to shine! ðŸŒŸ

The Design for Developers Wiki is a personal effort and you can help me to build it by [asking your design questions]().

<!-- [**Live Demo â†’**](https://nextra-docs-template.vercel.app) -->

## How the wiki works?

Developers will ask the questions and I will answer.

If the question seems like an opportunity for other people to learn from it I will add the answer to the wiki, so more developers can benefit from it.

## What kind of questions I can ask?

If you think your question may benefit you and others, then it is a good fit.

There's just one thing I ask:

**Don't show me your screen and ask if you design is good.** For this repo to work, I am looking for generic cases as they can benefit more people.

You can share an image to demonstrate your question, but if you are looking for Design Review, this is not the place.

## How can I send a question?

That's simple!

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/sheisacreative/design-for-developers-wiki/issues) in this repository.
2. Use the label "question" to indicate that it is a question.
3. Make sure your question is clear. You can even share an image to demonstrate it.

## Additional knowledge

- As an UI/UX Designer, I am interested in how developers think while they design.
- I will also be adding content to the wiki based on my own knowledge and experience.
- If you have suggestions for topics you'd like me to cover, feel free to submit an issue with the label "enhancement".

## Other comments

ðŸŒŸ I am a single person, so it may take a few days to answer your question.
ðŸŒŸ By the end of the day, I am just an adverturer designer in the Github world, please be patient as I am still learning about collaboration, open source and all this craziness. :P
ðŸŒŸ There's a huge chance you will find a few English errors in this project, as this is not my primary language. I will be really glad if you open an issue with the "enhancement" label reporting the error.
ðŸŒŸ If your company is looking for high quality design with outstangin level of excelence, I am a Freelance UI/UX Designer, feel free to [drop me a message](https://sheisacreative.com/contact).
