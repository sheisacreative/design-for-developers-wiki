2. Use the label "question" to indicate that it is a question.
3. Make sure your question is clear. You can even share an image to demonstrate it.

`⚠️ Note: please, don't show me your screen and ask if you design is good. For this repo to work, I am looking for generic cases as they can benefit more people. `

# ❓ How this wiki works

- You ask a question, I answer.
- If the question seems like an opportunity for other people to learn from it I will add the answer to the wiki.
- I'll also add general knowledge I've learned over the more than 10 years as a designer.
- With time we will have a trustfull source to learn and evolve the conversation beyond design and code.

<br>

# 🤔 Why this wiki?

- I want to help to break the barriers between design and code.
- I have a lot to share.
- We can learn and grow together.

<br>

# ➕ Additional knowledge

- As an UI/UX Designer, I am interested in how developers think while they design.
- I will also be adding content to the wiki based on my own knowledge and experience.
- If you have suggestions for topics you'd like me to cover, feel free to submit an issue with the label "enhancement".
