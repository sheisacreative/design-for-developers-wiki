# Design for Developers Wiki

The to-go place for developers who want to learn design, ask questions and more.

## Why a Design for Developers Wiki?

I am a UI/UX Designers for over 10 years now. Plus, coding has been one of my hobbies for a long time now.

The thing is: the more I study code, the mode I understand why developers design like they design (Yeah, I know you love an ID...)
